"Fuck, these aren't crackers." While sitting with her, trying to write a list of all the crackers on lined paper crisply folded along the lines. Later, she says, "if you want an iPad you'd better get it in Denver."

"Have you ever seen a moving while you ate?" She asks. "Once there was a tunnel with TVs playing one as we passed through... Yes, I guess I have." I reply. She was there for those.

We sit across from one another in the dining car. In a tunnel, a nuclear explosion happens somewhere outside. I try to think what we need if everything goes wrong. Shoes. Jackets. She forces me to look at her. "If we're separated, REMEMBER, astrophysicist, ..., he tried to have you killed." We touch for the first time, holding hands across the table, and wait for the blast wave.
