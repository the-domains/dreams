I was living in a small basement flat in a tall brown-brick building that threatened to topple into the water at any moment. It found itself not so close to the side of a busy waterfront street to be noticed. I had to take the back stairs leading to the river, but that was ok because it meant I had a riverside porch for the small price of being below some store.

I loved a quiet, unassuming life. I avoided the hustle, the bustle. I'd gathered a notable collection of... I can't quiet remember any more, but it was certainly notable. I would have been content spying on the crowded street through one of the above ground windows for the rest of my days. I do so enjoy people watching... and there's something unique about an ankle level perspective that you just don't get sitting at a cafe.

All that change the day I met... her.

She was a bundle of energy. Full of thoughts, plans, rumors. She practically dragged me off my feet. It's a testament to her charm that she convince me to... follow whatever her "unimpeachable plan!" had been. That "watertight plan!" of course set my house on fire, and made us fugitives of the law.

Before I knew it we were out of the city. Traveling north on a road. Apparently she could talk to wolves? She had a pair-a trio?-of wolves that helped us stay hidden as we moved north. Word must spread of our crime as an encountered on the road with some woodsmen nearly laid out in a ditch.

Once the authorities came for us with horses one of the wolves had mind to betrayed us. As we made for the foothills (a thought that ought to have occurred to us from the outset of our flight) one of the wolves stayed by the road. We never saw him again.

After some time we entered a surprisingly developed town for as far into the wilderness as we'd traveled. We wanted to change our looks. That wasn't hard for me as I'd the makings of a lush mountain-man beard. For her that meant a shorter cut than she liked. She made that clear.

In a move that certainly didn't help our status as wanted criminals we did some clothes shopping and wore out some new digs. She said it was their fault for putting the fitting rooms so close to the exit. At this point I figured I was so far gone what's another pair of jeans.

This was a pattern that repeated itself. There was no chance I was going to settle down again. We couldn't seem to stay ahead of our reputation. Even if we had there were no brown-brick buildings that threatened to fall on you as you enjoyed your waterfront porch this far into the hills.

In one town, we were caught up with. There was a standoff, we were split up in rows of bushes. They were closing in on her. I managed to get around the corner of a nearby building. She motioned for me to escape. I had no choice but to. I saw her
